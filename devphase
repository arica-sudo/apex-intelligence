MVP Development Roadmap
Phase 1: Core Foundation (Weeks 1-4)
Set up Next.js app with Tailwind + Framer Motion
Build URL input + basic validation
Integrate 2 free APIs (PageSpeed Insights, BuiltWith scraper)
Display results in simple cards (no 3D yet)
Milestone: User can enter URL and see basic tech stack + performance
Phase 2: Data Expansion (Weeks 5-8)
Integrate DataForSEO (backlinks, keywords, rankings)
Add traffic estimation (SimilarWeb or custom model)
Build PostgreSQL schema, user auth (Clerk or NextAuth)
Create dashboard with historical scans
Milestone: Functional SEO analysis tool
Phase 3: Visualization Layer (Weeks 9-12)
Implement Three.js competitive universe map
Add Recharts for traffic/ranking graphs
Glassmorphism UI redesign
Framer Motion transitions
Milestone: "Wow factor" interface
Phase 4: AI Intelligence (Weeks 13-16)
OpenAI integration for summaries
Build gap analysis algorithm
Create "Bridge Roadmap" generator
Add competitive comparison view
Milestone: Feature-complete core product
Phase 5: Polish & Scale (Weeks 17-20)
Performance optimization (lazy loading, code splitting)
Add WebGL particle effects
Implement real-time streaming updates
Beta user testing + bug fixes
Milestone: Production-ready MVP
Alternative Low-Budget MVP Strategy
If API costs are prohibitive initially: Bootstrapper Stack:
Free Data Sources:
Google Search Console API (requires user to connect their site)
PageSpeed Insights (free)
Manual scraping (Playwright + proxies)
Public datasets (Common Crawl for backlinks)
Build Your Own Estimators:
Traffic: Keyword volume × position CTR (use free SERPerator data)
Authority: Calculate your own "domain score" from public backlink data
Tech stack: Regex-based detection (90% accuracy possible)
Charge Earlier:
Offer free tier with 1 scan/month
$9.99/month for 10 scans (still profitable with free APIs)
Use revenue to unlock premium APIs gradually
This lets you ship in 8 weeks with $0 API costs, then layer in premium data as you scale.
Final Thoughts: The Moat
What makes Apex Intelligence defensible isn't any single API—competitors can access those too. The moats are:
Synthesis Quality: Your AI layer that turns raw data into strategic narratives
Visualization Superiority: The 3D interface makes dry data feel cinematic
The Bridge Algorithm: Quantified, actionable gap closure (not just "they're better")
Speed: Delivering insights in 30s that would take analysts 3 hours
Build this, and you'll have created the "god-mode view" that makes Semrush feel like a spreadsheet.
